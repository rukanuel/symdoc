# Symdoc Security Policy

## Introduction

Thank you for using Symdoc. I prioritize the security of Symdoc to provide a safe, reliable experience for all users. This document outlines the security practices and guidance on reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

Symdoc maintains support for the following versions, with critical security updates and patches as needed:

- **Latest Major Release** - Actively supported with bug and security patches.
- **Previous Major Release** - Maintained only for critical security issues.

I recommend upgrading to the latest version whenever possible to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Symdoc, please report it to me immediately. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until I have had a chance to address it. Responsible disclosure helps me mitigate any potential harm to users.

**How to report:**
1. Email me at **rukanuel@gmail.com** with the subject "Security Issue: Symdoc".
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
3. Share any additional information or materials that may help us understand and address the issue quickly.

## Handling Sensitive Data

Symdoc does not collect, process, or store sensitive data such as passwords, credit card information, or personal user data. However, I advise users to follow general best practices for securing any files or data generated by Symdoc, particularly when used in production environments.

### Security Requirements

1. **Dependencies**: Symdoc relies on third-party libraries, such as `nikic/php-parser` and components from Symfony. All dependencies are maintained up-to-date to address known vulnerabilities. Please ensure Composer dependencies are regularly updated.
  
2. **Permissions**: Run Symdoc commands with the minimum privileges necessary, especially in production environments. Avoid running as a root user when not required.

3. **Environment Variables**: Store all sensitive environment configurations outside of publicly accessible directories and repositories. Symdoc does not require any environment variables to function but may be configured to interact with Symfony project environments where this applies.

4. **Autoloading**: Symdoc uses `psr-4` autoloading conventions. Ensure that your `composer.json` file is secure and does not expose sensitive paths or code. Use `optimize-autoloader` in production environments for optimized loading.

## Security in Development

For contributors and developers working on Symdoc:

1. **Local Development**: Use isolated development environments (such as Docker or virtual environments) to avoid conflicts with other projects and reduce risk.
  
2. **Testing**: Symdoc uses PHPUnit for testing. Always run tests before committing changes to ensure compatibility and security compliance. Avoid exposing the test environment to the public.

3. **Pull Requests**: All contributions are reviewed, and any changes with potential security implications are subjected to additional scrutiny.

Thank you for helping me keep Symdoc secure for everyone!
